Boolean-based SQL Injection (Blind Injection)
-	A type of technique that relies on sending an SQL query to the database system on which the technique forces the application to return different results.
-	In other words, this type of SQL Injection is a type of SQL Injection Attack that relies on the applicationsâ€™ response to Boolean (TRUE or FALSE) conditions to extract information from a database system.
-	In this type of SQLIA, an attacker can inject malicious SQL query into the application to infer the structure and contents of the underlying database system.

Time-based SQL Injection (Timing Injection)
-	An attacker can send a SQL query to the database system, which will make the database wait (for a period in seconds) before it can react. The attacker can see from the time the database takes to respond, whether a query is true or false. 
-	In other words, an attacker can send a SQL query/command to the server with code to force a delay in the execution of the queries. The response time indicates whether the result of the SQL query is TRUE or FALSE. Depending on the response, the attacker will execute another query. 
-	Because the attacker has to enumerate each character by character, this is usually a slow intrusion technique, especially for large databases. 
-	For example, the attacker can use WAITFOR

!!!!!!!!This type of attack as I know is more focusing on guessing or inferencing the structure of database system than extracting the data. Ya, I think it will also extract the secret information but the attackers firstly will guess or infer the structure.

There are two types inside this SQLIA,
First one is Boolean-based
- My PHP is something like if attackers inject 'AND 1=1, it will return always TRUE, 
if 'AND 1=0, it will always return FALSE.

The second one is Time-based
- This one is something like attackers will inject WAITFOR DELAY and then it will delay for a few seconds, 
in my coding I set to 5 seconds.
