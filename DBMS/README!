SQLIA – Stored Procedure
The concept of stored procedure inside the SQLIA is something like below: - 
-	The stored procedure usually is inside a database system (Simple word: A database system got a stored procedure). This stored procedure is a pre-defined set of SQL instructions that the database executes to perform specific tasks. These stored procedures are often used for tasks like checking user credentials or interacting with other parts of the database system. 
-	However, an attacker can use/exploits the stored procedure to inject malicious input into the parameters used by a stored procedure. The attacker could insert extra comments into the procedure (such as DROP TABLE, SHUTDOWN), and this will cause the database system to behave in an unintended harmful way.
For example:
•	A stored procedure for checking user login might be vulnerable to an injection attack if it does not properly sanitize inputs. If an attacker injects something like '; DROP TABLE users; --, it could result in the procedure executing that extra malicious query, 
which in this case would delete the "users" table.

In my storedprocedure.php, I demonstarte something like if attackers insert ';DROP TABLE users;--, it will show message 
that this is malicious input attack, and if I take copy the SQL query to MySQL there, it will DROP
the TABLE.
